ble_receiver.py
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRIMARY UNO Q receiver: runs on the UNO Q's Linux (Debian / Qualcomm) side,
where the BLE radio actually lives. Uses `bleak` to scan for the Nano 33 BLE
peripheral named "NanoIMU", subscribe to its IMU characteristic, and print
each payload (raw CSV + parsed values).

Payload format (from nano_imu_ble_sender.ino):
    IMU,timestamp_ms,ax_ms2,ay_ms2,az_ms2,gx_dps,gy_dps,gz_dps

Setup (on the UNO Q Linux side):
    pip install bleak
Run:
    python3 ble_receiver.py

Supabase upload is intentionally NOT implemented yet -- see the TODO stub.
