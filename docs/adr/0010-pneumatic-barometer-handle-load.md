# Sense Handle Load with a pneumatic bladder + barometer, not an FSR

**Handle Load** — Moon Walk's weight-bearing / offload signal — is sensed by turning the
Nano 33 BLE's onboard **LPS22HB barometer** into a pneumatic load cell, **replacing the
previously-planned multi-FSR grip**. A soft sealed air bladder (~25–35 cm², silicone dome
or heat-sealed TPU pouch) sits under the handle grip; the user's load compresses it,
raising the trapped-air pressure, which a thin silicone tube pipes to the barometer sealed
in a 3D-printed manifold. A bench calibration against a bathroom scale maps pressure → kgf
(`P = F / A`). Full engineering rationale and figures: `docs/pneumatic-load-sensing.html`
and `docs/pneumatic-bladder-build.html`.

**Why.**
- *Sensors in hand, $0 BOM.* We have an LSM9DS1 IMU and an LPS22HB barometer on the board,
  and cannot buy more. The barometer was otherwise unused; the only added part is a soft
  bladder + tube + printed manifold — no FSR, no load cell, no ADC.
- *We need a repeatable trend, not a scale.* Weight-bearing compliance targets are coarse
  ("30–50% body weight", "20 kg ± 10 kg") and the incumbent — a therapist's tactile guess —
  is wrong by 20–30%. A relative load trend good to ~10–20% already matches or beats clinical
  practice. This makes Moon Walk a **compliance coach, not a scale**, and is exactly the
  signal the WSFC threshold engine needs ([ADR-0009]).
- *The geometry forces the design.* The LPS22HB has only ~25 kPa of usable headroom above
  ambient. To keep 35 kgf in-window the contact area must be large (`A = F/P ≈ 136 cm²`),
  so the bladder goes **under the handle**, not in the ferrule — a rigid tip piston (~2.8 cm²)
  would need ~MPa pressures, bursting the chamber and saturating the sensor instantly.
- *The IMU cancels barometer drift for free.* A sealed gas chamber drifts (hand heat,
  elastomer creep, micro-leaks) by an amount comparable to the signal. The IMU already
  detects the **swing phase** — cane in the air, load = exactly zero — so we **auto-tare**
  the baseline every gait cycle. One free move cancels thermal drift, creep, and leak.

**Decisions.**
- Handle Load = trapped-air pressure under the grip, read by the LPS22HB; soft bladder under
  the **handle** (rejected: rigid piston in the ferrule); operate near the bottom of the
  pressure range with per-step auto-tare.
- Calibrate once on a bathroom scale (5/10/20/30 kgf), fit a **2nd-order polynomial** →
  kgf on-device. (Marquardt et al. 2022's barometer-in-silicone force sensor is "almost
  linear" but is best fit by a quadratic, R²≈0.996 — a straight line under-fits the
  elastomer's mild nonlinearity. See [`rehab/wsfc-processing-references.md`].)
- **Tare strategy is per-application** (amended 2026-05-27, see below): the WSFC rehab
  application uses a **session-start tare after thermal equilibration**, *not* the
  per-swing auto-tare. Per-swing auto-tare is rescoped to the long, unsupervised
  wellness-monitoring application.
- Glossary updated: **Handle Load** and the **Sensor suite** in [`CONTEXT.md`] now describe
  the pneumatic/barometer sensor; "FSR" / "load cell" are retired terms for this signal.

**Consequences.**
- **The WSFC's supposed blocker dissolves.** Handle Load is now measurable with hardware in
  hand, so the real-time weight-support feedback loop is buildable now — [ADR-0009] is
  corrected accordingly (its "FSR not acquired = #1 blocker" framing is obsolete).
- **kgf vs the no-absolute-force boundary is an open tension.** This sensor *can* output kgf
  (±10–20%), but [ADR-0001] / [`docs/FEATURES.md`] say "never Newtons / %body-weight." The
  WSFC clinical line may use kgf-relative targets while the wellness line keeps relative
  trends only — a per-application split to be resolved in the FEATURES/PRD pass.
- **Open question — does the pressure stay in-window?** The two design docs are not
  numerically consistent: `pneumatic-load-sensing.html` says the LPS22HB has only ~25 kPa of
  usable headroom and that fitting 340 N into it needs **~136 cm²**, yet the specified bladder
  is **25–35 cm²**; `pneumatic-bladder-build.html` claims 35 kgf on a 30 cm² pad gives ~110 kPa
  ("soft wall absorbs most") — ~4.4× that ceiling and near the sensor's full-scale. So the top
  of the 7–35 kgf range may **saturate**. Mitigant: the WSFC cares about *offloading* (low/mid
  loads, "operate at the bottom of the range"), so high-load saturation is tolerable — but the
  bladder area, soft-wall offloading, and usable load span must be **bench-measured**, not
  assumed. **Update (2026-05-27): the bladder is now built, bench-calibrated, and
  drift/hysteresis-validated** (see Milestone below) — so the projected numbers in this section
  are superseded by the actual bench measurements, which must be recorded there.
- **New failure modes to validate:** bladder puncture/leak (the docs' stated #1 failure — a
  glued joint must hold a squeeze ≥10 s), tube kinks, temperature swings outside what swing-tare
  can cancel, and calibration drift over time. The accuracy claim (~10–20% repeatable relative
  trend) must be bench-verified before any compliance claim.
- ToF Distance remains the only un-acquired sensor; Stick Cycle phase still falls back to
  IMU stillness until it lands.

## Amendment (2026-05-27): per-swing auto-tare is a wellness-mode feature, not a WSFC requirement

This ADR's original "the IMU auto-tares the baseline **every gait cycle**" framing was
inherited from the all-day, unsupervised wellness-monitoring use case. For the **WSFC rehab
application** it is **over-engineering**, and is replaced by a **session-start tare after a
brief thermal equilibration**, plus a clinician one-button manual re-zero.

**Why the reversal (evidence in [`rehab/wsfc-processing-references.md`]):**
- *Our sensor architecture is the most drift-stable, not the least.* Dabling et al. 2012
  benchmarked five interface-pressure sensors; the fluid/air-bubble pressure sensor (= our
  bladder + barometer) had the **lowest drift of all** — 2.3% static (18 h), 2.8% hysteresis,
  1.8% cyclic (vs FSRs 6–21%, capacitive 24%). Scaled to a ~30-minute supervised rehab
  session ([ADR-0009] dose), residual zero-drift is small.
- *Thermal drift is the dominant mechanism, and it is front-loaded and asymptotic* — largest
  in the first minutes after gripping the warm handle, then settles. Marquardt et al. 2022 —
  the only barometer-in-elastomer analog — handles it with **~10 min equilibration + a single
  per-trial offset, explicitly because trials are short**, and does **not** re-tare continuously.
- *No clinical PWB system re-tares per step.* Jung 2015, Kang 2021, and Tamburella 2021 all
  zero once per session (in fact none documents a tare procedure at all — a session-start tare
  is something we are *inventing*, grounded in Marquardt, not copying).
- *The relative-to-baseline decision cancels common-mode drift.* The over-lean target is a %
  of the patient's baseline cane-dependence measured **after** equilibration in the same
  session; a slowly-drifting zero shifts the live reading and the baseline together and
  largely subtracts out of the ratio.
- *Per-swing auto-tare adds a failure path.* It couples the load zero to correct IMU swing
  detection; a missed or false swing injects a bad re-zero into a **safety beep**. Fewer
  coupled failure paths is safer.

**Decision (amended):**
- **WSFC rehab application:** session-start tare after the patient grips and the bladder
  equilibrates (fold into the setup walk that measures baseline cane-dependence, so baseline
  and live readings share the same settled offset); clinician manual re-zero available. The
  IMU's swing detection is kept for **step segmentation only**, decoupled from the load zero.
- **Wellness-monitoring application:** per-swing auto-tare (and/or a slowly-updated
  differential baseline, per Manivannan et al. 2020) is retained — that long, unsupervised,
  environment-varying regime is what it is actually for.

**Build note:** to keep bladder hysteresis low, place the bladder **in series with the load
path** and minimise surrounding viscoelastic bulk (Wheeler et al. 2011 found hysteresis is
driven by molding the sensor *into* the elastomer). Micro-leak rate is undocumented in the
literature — **bench-verify the seal** on the actual hardware (a glued joint must hold a
squeeze ≥10 s).

## Prior art (the technique is established; the application is novel)

Barometer-as-load-cell is peer-reviewed, not invented here. Encapsulating a MEMS barometer in
elastomer yields a robust force sensor (**TakkTile**, Tenzer/Jentoft/Howe ~2014; **Cerveri 2017**,
*IEEE Trans. Haptics*, RMSE 0.04 N, [DOI 10.1109/TOH.2016.2636822]); a 2022 review reports such
sensors at **~10% force error to 25 N** ([DOI 10.3390/mi13112051]). Reading pressure *inside a
sealed air cell* to infer load has a direct validated analog in active-wheelchair cushions
([DOI 10.1088/1873-4030/ae2463]). The **novel** part is the cane-handle + per-step auto-tare
application; published barometer-force accuracy (~10%) is consistent with our ~10–20% goal, and the
known hysteresis/drift of interface pressure sensors (Polliack ~2000) is precisely what auto-tare
counters. The clinical premise — PWB is coarse and badly estimated (Dabke 2004: ~35% BW over;
Yu 2014: clinicians "unable to gauge" it), and real-time biofeedback beats scale training
(Lisitano 2025 RCT, d≈1.8) — is likewise well-supported. Full citations + DOIs:

## Milestone (2026-05-27): bladder built, bench-calibrated, and validated

The pneumatic Handle Load sensor is no longer a design concept — it is **physically built,
bench-calibrated against a reference scale, and drift/hysteresis-validated.** This unblocks the
entire WSFC loading stack (CONTEXT.md, `docs/metrics.md` §3 — Handle Load + WS Target Compliance
move from *gated* to *available*).

**Bench results — to be filled in** (these supersede the projected numbers in the rationale
above; replace each `TODO` with the measured value and date, then delete this note):

| What | Projected / assumed (rationale above) | Measured (TODO) | Pass? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Calibration polynomial `a, b, c` | 2nd-order, Marquardt-2022 R²≈0.996 | `TODO` (a=…, b=…, c=…; R²=…) | `TODO` |
| Bladder area used | 25–35 cm² | `TODO` cm² | — |
| Usable load span | target 7–35 kgf | `TODO` kgf | `TODO` |
| Top-of-range **saturation** (open Q) | may saturate (~4.4× ceiling, ~110 kPa) | `TODO` (yes/no, at … kgf) | `TODO` |
| Static drift (~30-min session) | 2.3% (Dabling 2012, 18 h scaled) | `TODO` % | `TODO` (≤ session budget?) |
| Hysteresis | 2.8% (Dabling 2012) | `TODO` % | `TODO` |
| Repeatable relative-trend accuracy | ~10–20% goal | `TODO` % | `TODO` |
| Seal / leak (squeeze-hold ≥10 s) | undocumented in literature | `TODO` (pass/fail, held … s) | `TODO` |
| Session-start tare sufficient? | yes (drift cancels in ratio) | `TODO` (confirmed / re-zero needed) | `TODO` |

Once filled: if drift/hysteresis land within the session budget and the polynomial hits the
~10–20% goal, the DSP load path is sufficient and **[ADR-0012] #2 (the ML load denoiser) is not
built** — record that outcome there too.

## Status

accepted; amended 2026-05-27 (tare strategy is per-application — see Amendment above) and
**bladder built + bench-calibrated + drift/hysteresis-validated 2026-05-27 (see Milestone
above)**. Supersedes the multi-FSR grip assumption carried in earlier docs/ADRs. Remaining:
record the actual bench-measured values (polynomial, load span/saturation, drift %) into the
rationale section, replacing the superseded projections.
